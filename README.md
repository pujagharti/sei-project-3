# Installation:
 
* Install dependencies: run npm i in Terminal
 
* Start the database: run mongod --dbpath ~/data/db in Terminal
 
* Seed the database either via:
 
 * running npm run seed in Terminal. This will seed the database using the file at ./db/seeds.js, which uses a small number of user data that we have provided.
 
 * running npm run seedexternal in Terminal. This will seed the database using the file at ./db/seedexternal.js, which uses faker (https://www.npmjs.com/package/faker) to populate the database with the user data.
 
* Start the backend server: run npm run dev
 
* Navigate in your browser to localhost:4000/. You should see the frontend being served to the browser.

# Challenges
Using semantic UI react for styling was really challenging because it was difficult to style and target the one component.
 
# Wins
Working on a team and communicating regular tasks, solving issues together, pair-coding was a great win.
